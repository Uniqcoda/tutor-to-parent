# TUTOR TO PARENT APP

## An online platform that matches Professional Private tutors to Parents for their kids.

## Description
An online platform that matches Professional Private tutors to Parents.

## Problem Statement
There is a need for professional private tutors for children that need extra classes to either improve academically or acquire a new skill. Also, there are tutors who are finding it difficult to locate children that have special academic needs or children who want to learn a new skill such as coding, catering, music, dancing and so on. Such skills are not usually taught in school and when they are taught, the teaching methods are not designed to meet the specific need of each child.

This platform will match tutors with parents for private lessons.
